# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow checks out code, performs a Codacy security scan
# and integrates the results with the
# GitHub Advanced Security code scanning feature.
# For more information on the Codacy security scan action usage and
# parameters, see https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli-action.
# For more information on Codacy Analysis CLI in general, see
